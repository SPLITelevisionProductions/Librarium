# Librarium

A web-application for managing your Book collection.

This is a beta version of Librarium, using MySQL to store user and book data, with cover art being stored in files on the web server.

Libarium is located at http://librarium.x10.mx/

Eventually, this will be replaced by the preview version once it is feature-par. In the meantime, no new features will be added to the main website (but some may be added to this one for e.g., owner management).
