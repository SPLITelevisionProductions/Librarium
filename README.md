# Librarium (Preview)

A web-application for managing your Book, DVD, CD, Game and/or Magazine collection (or whatever you choose to collect, really)

This is a preview version of Librarium, being developed to use SQLite to store the user's collection and cover art, with a separate database for each user, whilst still using MySQL to handle the management of the users themselves.

This preview will be located at http://preview.librarium.x10.mx/

Eventually, this will replace the main website once it is feature-par. In the meantime, no new features will be added to the main website (but some may be added to this one for e.g., owner management).

Improvements being looked into so far are:

- A new login system
- Improved item management
- Improved cover art storage
- Improved overall design
- Improved fluidity on mobile
